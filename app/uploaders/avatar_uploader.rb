  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # storage :file
  storage :fog

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url(*args)

  #   # ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))

  # process scale: [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb do
  #   process resize_to_fit: [50, 50]
  # end
  version :thumb do
    process resize_to_fill: [100, 100]

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
